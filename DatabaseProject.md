# Unit 3 SQL Database Project

## **Criteria A: Planning** ##

### *Initial Problem*

My client for this project is my dad, and he wanted me to create an app for him to manage all the characters he has created in the video game World of Warcraft. Prior to this request, he had no system in place in order to manage these characters. As he does not play World of Warcraft much anymore, continuing to pay the monthly subscription is costly whereas creating an app is free and also does not require internet connection. My dad meticulously created each character he played and put a lot of care into what kind of characters they would be, so having a place to store all of them would make him happy.

### *So What Will It Look Like?*

The app that I am creating is not very big or powerful. All that the app is expected to do is have the user log in with an email and password, then taking them to a page that lists all of their WoW characters they have created as well as the attributes pertaining to each individual character such as level, race, etc. The user is also able to edit existing character information, create new characters, and delete old ones if desired. Features such as including other MMOs in the app are not currently needed but could be a way to update the software in the future if the client desires. The app will run on my dad's computer and only his computer, meaning there is no need for the program to communicate with other devices and does not need to work offline. If there are technical issues then he will report them to me and I will fix them for him. The program itself should run no matter which OS he chooses to use as Kivy is multi-platform.

### ***Success Criteria*** 
- Use a login system with an email and password
- Have the ability to create new characters
- Include the option to delete pre-existing characters
- The ability to edit pre-existing characters' attributes
- Characters have attributes that are displayed and categorized
